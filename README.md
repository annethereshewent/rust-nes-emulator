# Rust NES Emulator

This is yet another NES emulator written in Rust, as a fun side project to learn the language and get a feel for low level programming. Still a work in progress, but it plays many of the first generation NES games released, such as Super Mario Bros, Pac-man, Donkey Kong, Ice Climber, and others.

Currently only the graphics are implemented, audio is still a work in progress.
