# Rust NES Emulator

This is yet another NES emulator written in Rust. I wanted to get more experience doing low level programming, and I decided that this would be a fun way to learn a new programming language. Still a work in progress, but it plays many of the first generation NES games released, such as Super Mario Bros, Pac-man, Donkey Kong, Ice Climber, Excite Bike, and others.

Currently only the graphics are implemented, audio is still a work in progress.

Currently there are two ways of running the emulator:

* Desktop App
* Web app

## Desktop app

To compile the desktop app, run `cargo build --release`. Then, with the executable generated, run `./nes-emulator <path-to-game>`.

## Web app

Web app is still in progress.
